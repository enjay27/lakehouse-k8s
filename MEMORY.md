# Active Infrastructure State

**Index, not the record.** Only what would be *false* the moment it goes stale lives here;
everything else is a link into [`.memory/`](.memory/README.md).

## Now — 2026-09-16 late (refactored v5 live; pipeline review awaits decisions)

**Start here next session:** [`logging/HANDOFF-pipeline-next-2026-09-16.md`](logging/HANDOFF-pipeline-next-2026-09-16.md) — state, rules, ordered tasks. Docs index: [`logging/README.md`](logging/README.md).

**Running:** `benchmarks-fluent-bit` pod `qr4br`, policy/report schema **v5**, one Lua filter (`#31`, sha `2fbcfa47c513f5a0`),
no thread/ndc fields in `polaris-logs-*` (`#30`, rev 19). Verified on traffic 15:01Z. **`WINDOW_SECONDS` is still 30.**

**Rules:** Lua only → `apply-lua.sh`; values only → step2 → `helm upgrade` → step3; both → `apply-lua.sh --no-restart` → step2 →
`helm upgrade`, no restart between. Readouts: `step10` + `step11`, not Dev Tools copies.

**Next:** (1) review measurements M1–M5 (K) → (2) decide P1–P12 of [`REVIEW-pipeline`](logging/REVIEW-pipeline-2026-09-16.md) →
(3) P1 roll while windows are 30 s → (4) 1800 s window → (5) delete 30 s report indices (explicit OK) → phase 3.
**ISM / retention: Monitoring team, not ours.** `#29` dropped.

**Standing.** Polaris is not to be changed. **Verify against the running object, never an intent artifact.**

## Where the detail is

| read | when |
|---|---|
| [`.memory/environments.md`](.memory/environments.md) | **before running anything** — context, namespaces, ports, and the no-cluster-reach constraint on Cowork sessions |
| [`.memory/active-issues.md`](.memory/active-issues.md) | before trusting a value or a runbook |
| [`.memory/roadmap.md`](.memory/roadmap.md) | what is next, and the PostgreSQL verification assertions |
| [`.memory/repository-map.md`](.memory/repository-map.md) | looking for where something lives, or which duplicate values file is current |
| [`.memory/goal.md`](.memory/goal.md) | the standing objective and the structural model |
| [`.memory/sessions/`](.memory/sessions/) | why a decision was made, including the wrong turns |
| [`.memory/completed.md`](.memory/completed.md) | finished structural work |
| `logging/README.md` | which `logging/` document is current (the 09-03 architecture spec is historical) |

## Rules for keeping this file useful

- **Under ~40 lines.** It reached 80 by accumulating,each session, a digest of findings
  already filed in `.memory/`. **A paragraph summarising a file that exists does not belong
  here.** *Now* carries what is next and what is written but not running; nothing else.
- **Update *Now* every session**, even when the answer is "unchanged".
- **A fact with a number goes in `.memory/roadmap.md`; the story goes in
  `.memory/sessions/`.** Configuration that is written but not applied goes in
  `.memory/active-issues.md` — in this repo that distinction is the whole game.
