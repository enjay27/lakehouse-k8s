# Active issues — check here before trusting a value or a runbook

Status vocabulary: **OPEN** (will bite you), **OPEN QUESTION** (unknown, cheap to
settle), **RESOLVED-INSTRUCTIVE** (fixed, kept because the failure mode recurs).

## Open

**#1 — The repo has not been reconciled against the live cluster. OPEN.**
Kade reset and rebuilt the cluster on 2026-09-03 without following
`RESET-AND-CLEAN-INSTALL.md`, and resolved the four config blockers during the
install. Those fixes are in the running releases; whether they are also in the
`values.yaml` files here is **unknown**. Until someone diffs them, nothing on disk
is evidence of what is deployed:

```bash
helm -n datahub-hynix list
helm -n datahub-hynix get values <release> > /tmp/<release>-live.yaml   # then diff
```

The four blockers this closes out — Polaris `bootstrapCredentials` rendering `""`,
three conflicting MinIO credential sets (one of them plaintext at
`spark/values.yaml:30`), the stale `polaris-persistence-secret.yaml`, and the
unpinned images in `kafka/` / `schema-registry/` / `datahub/` — are **resolved in
the cluster**. Two of them are worth checking on disk regardless: a plaintext
secret key stays a leaked secret even after the cluster stops using it, and an
unpinned image is still unpinned for the next install.

**#2 — Which sink does the Fluent Bit DaemonSet actually ship to? OPEN QUESTION.**
Kade confirmed the DaemonSet runs and works. `logging/fb-values.yaml` on disk (still
uncommitted) points at VictoriaLogs in namespace `logging` via an HTTP `jsonline`
output; the committed version points at Elasticsearch; and OpenSearch is running in
Docker outside the cluster. One `kubectl -n datahub-hynix get cm <fb-configmap> -o yaml`
settles it, and then the tech stack in `CLAUDE.md` can say so plainly.

## Resolved, kept because they recur

**#F1 — An entire values block was inert for months. RESOLVED-INSTRUCTIVE.**
`postgresql/` is an umbrella chart. Helm passes values to a subchart only when
nested under the subchart's name — everything at the top level was silently
ignored, and the cluster ran on subchart defaults:

| intended | actually in effect |
|---|---|
| `max_connections = 200` | **100** |
| `shared_buffers = 384MB` | 128MB |
| `log_min_duration_statement = 1000` | -1 (off) |
| `persistence.size: 10Gi` | 8Gi |
| explicit 2Gi resources | `resourcesPreset: micro` |
| `disableLoadBalancingOnWrite: always` | `transaction` |
| `/dev/shm` emptyDir | not mounted (64MB default) |

Detected by comparing a value against the **subchart default**, not against the
values file: `pgpool.replicaCount: 3` with one pgpool pod running proved the block
was dead. `postgresql.replicaCount: 3` matched only because 3 is also the default —
a coincidence, not evidence. **Verify against defaults, never against intent.**
This is also why #1 above matters: the rebuild is exactly the moment that gap
reopens.

**#F2 — `0.0.0.0/0` does not match IPv6. RESOLVED-INSTRUCTIVE.**
The custom `pgHbaConfiguration` was IPv4-only; OrbStack's pod network is IPv6
(`fd00::/8`), so repmgr's pod-to-pod connection was rejected and a standby went
into CrashLoopBackOff. It never bit while #F1 was in force, because Bitnami's
*default* pg_hba includes `::/0`. **Un-inerting configuration that has never
executed is a change, not a fix** — review it line by line against the defaults it
replaces.

## Standing constraints

- **`persistence.size` is now-or-never.** A PVC cannot be grown in place after
  install. Whatever the rebuild set is what this cluster has.
- **Resource footprint.** The full set (DataHub + prerequisites + Kafka + Spark +
  Airflow) needs >7GB RAM on the daemon node.
- **`ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries` replaces, it does not append.**
  Running it bare drops `repmgr` and silently disables automatic failover.
  `postgresql.auto.conf` lives on each pod's PVC and does not replicate.
- **`git status` hygiene.** `.gitignore` covers `.idea`, `node_modules`,
  `postgresql-ha-*.tgz` and `.DS_Store`. Still check `git status` **before**
  `git add -A`, never after — chart tarballs and `helm get values` exports are not
  covered by any pattern.
